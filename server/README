Works on Linux:
	Using the terminal go the directory and compile using the make command.
	Run server with ./snake_server command.

Untested for Windows:


Currently cannot run on Mac:


The server should generate a highscores.txt file with all the highscores
of the users.
Should be able to perform the goals of Milestone 3.
There are several bugs.
BUGS:
The game in its current state cannot be played repeatedly within the same session.
The server must be restarted for each game.
The server may have issues with starting the game if a client gets ready and leaves
and another client joins and gets ready.
The client needs to refresh to clear the drawings on the canvas.
Client: Sometimes improperly draws snakes, does not affect gameplay though.
